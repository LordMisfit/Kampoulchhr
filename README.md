# Kampoulchhr
"Kampoulchhr" or "KC" is also a character/weapon/monster gameplay modification for GZDoom. 

Unlike "Aetherius" and "Explosive Expedition", my previous two GZDoom gameplay modifications, the protagonist, 'Heiwa' is a totally original character of my own creation, as opposed to that of Flora (of Dragon Quest fame) in Aetherius and Dinah Wyck (creation of Mike MacDee) of Explosive Expedition. 

Heiwa is an alternative 'incarnation' of a character from yet another non-game based fictional work of my own. A sort of alternate reality version, even to the point that as it is soon learned, she doesn't even remember her true name or the memories of her friends and family.

Hailing from the late 1990s, the 15-year old Heiwa only goes by that "name" as it is the one 'nickname' or 'codename' she can even remember of her old life, even as she suddenly finds herself on the moon of Phobos in the year 2145 (the setting of E1M1 of The Ultimate Doom), with but her wits and a family heirloom knife from her maternal grandfather, a fallen Vietnam veteran who died of mysterious reasons himself during the war.

Additionally, the Doom Marine of this specific universe/timeline, whom would've been there instead of her, has vanished from Phobos at the same moment Heiwa would appear in his place, effectively swapping Heiwa into HIS role, leaving her to fend for herself against the increasing hordes of Hell across multiple war and combat theatres, and the original marine's fate entirely unknown.

The lore of Kampoulchhr intends to expand behind Heiwa's interactions with the events of The Ultimate Doom and Doom 2: Hell on Earth's events as well. Likely events such as TNT: Evolution and The Plutonia Experiment, and several others will come forth as Heiwa must uncover what is looking more and more like a Multiversal-level conspiracy to keep her true memories and her true name out of her reach by an unknown force or entity, one that even the realm -Hell- and its mightiest warriors and rulers, are but a mere series of unwitting PAWNS to. The true question is, why has Heiwa been put in this situation, and what is the true intention of the entity behind all of this??

Like with EE, KC avoids use of DECORATE and ACS entirely for anything outside of map effects, exclusively using ZScript as well. Additionally, like with EE and Aetherius, all of the same monsters [excluding the EE-exclusive ones] return in this one as the lion's share of Heiwa's opponents.

However Heiwa, even in her weakest state, isn't the helpless-looking teenage girl even she currently thinks she is, being in possession of a incredible power to halt the flow of time around her, leaving only herself exempt, for at least 10 seconds at once, which seems to increase in duration and effectiveness the more she uses it (i.e. the central power/mechanic of the mod that separates it from the IP system of EE, and the Magic/Tension system of Aetherius). This gives Heiwa a lot of options for approaching combat that Flora and Dinah, and even the Doom Marine couldn't consider.

This modification is still heavily beta though, especially in terms to graphics for the character being lacking at the moment, but more is planned in the future. :V
