However... Unbeknownst to both you -AND- the Gatekeeper, your figh-
ting has -NOT- gone unnoticed...

The entity responsible for your plight, for your 'horrible situation'
is still out there. They are waiting for you, as well as those beings
who serve them without any hesitation or remorse... 

And soon, your first true contact with them will be made, and it will
come at a tragic cost... A cost you cannot possibly predict or com-
prehend...

Nor will you fully be able to understand -WHY- this being has been
so hellbent on keeping your true identity and your name from being
revealed to you. It fears you more than you can ever realize, for
reasons you've yet to even consider...

And unfortunately, the Gatekeeper's hubris in using that prototype
accelerator will soon force their hand. The foolish demon had att-
empted to break into an astral reality under this entity's dominion,
and it has been greatly offended by the young demon's meddling...

The only clue you have at this point to what is coming is a brief
image in your recent dreams of a shadowy being with what seems
to be a trio of eyes, one large eye, and two smaller ones. One bares
a silhouette of yourself, another the winged emblem on your spe-
cial artifacts, and one completely unknown symbol, one that will
haunt your dreams for much time to come...
