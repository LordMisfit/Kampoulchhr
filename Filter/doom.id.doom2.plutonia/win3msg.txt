You return in the opposite direction of which you came to this place.
Your path takes you through the 'Temple of Darkness' you left beh-
ind you hours back, the last intact structure remaining from the in-
vasion you stopped with the Gatekeeper's demise. 

He had mentioned that the temple was an old haunt of his from ages
ago when he roamed the planet to study the humans of this reality in
preparation for the invasion Baphomet led not long ago.

As you study the temple over, almost absentmindedly, you muse over
your own time in this reality. You've fought through Phobos, Deimos,
Earth, Hell, Io, and now this Temple of Darkness in the South Amer-
ican continent. And yet, as the Gatekeeper's story revealed, some of
Hell's forces yet still remain, and will in time attempt to rebuild
their ranks. He even dropped little hints/taunts of possibly a stray
outpost out there somewhere in the nearby solar system.

You remember the name 'Isha' in there somewhere. Perhaps that's 
your next clue of where you need to go... but where even is this 
world...?

That and also the fact that the Gatekeeper's also didn't seem to kn-
ow anything you could use to recall your own true name and iden-
tity. He even found it odd you had no memories of yourself, but had
the respect to commend you for your prowess as a warrior despite 
lacking your own memories...

However it's funny... because despite no knowledge of -your- name
being found... and despite never revealing his own 'name' to you,
somehow you still know it anyways... "Xenolatias, the Webcarver"...
