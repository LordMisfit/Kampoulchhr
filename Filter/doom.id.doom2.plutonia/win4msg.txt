'Xenolatias The Webcarver'... he -DID- liken himself and his species
to being like spiders who could crawl along the webs of time and
space... Able to create gates between worlds like nothing...

Was it possible you aren't truly just a human all this time? Are the
powers of Gatekeepers something that you might one day gain the
ability to use for yourself?

In fact, you remember those strange artifacts you found long back
during all of this. That winged emblem you remember shared among
all three of them. That emblem -HAS- to has -SOME- history to it in
this reality, right?

You sigh depressedly to yourself, as you leave the Temple of Dark-
ness with some new knowledge and having hidden away a few of
the late Gatekeeper's hidden artifacts with you, including one that
you believe could later shed light on that odd artifact you found
on Io in the Ice Weasel's former tomb. You left that one back at
the UAC this time, but you know it'll come into play again event-
ually.

You are soon found by the UAC's retrieval squadrons, led by Sgt.
Kelly, an old 'friend' of yours you got to know between Baphomet's
death and the Io incident. You brief him on the situation, and he
has his marines investigate the regions you had to move through
previously, as he has a second transport pick you up and take you
back 'home'.

Home? Well, at least Daisy's there. You need her role as a comfort
pet even more now than before. Thank goodness for small favors...
