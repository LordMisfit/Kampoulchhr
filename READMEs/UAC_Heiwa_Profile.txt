(Misfit's Word of God Note: The following file is written from the perspective of various UAC officials as a combined group about Heiwa, and it is assumed it is written at some point AFTER the events of her version of Doom 2: Hell on Earth, post Icon of Sin battle at the earliest :V)

Date of Creation: December 11th, 2145
Date of Last Update: May 21st, 2146 (Update #108)

* Full Name: [First Name Corrupted] M. [Surname Corrupted] 
	- Extra Note 1: Currently only known as 'Heiwa', a codename she has said herself seems to be an old memory of a nickname of hers. Heiwa is actually a name of Japanese origin [i.e 平和], being the word for 'peace', which is extremely ironic considering it was Heiwa who ultimately led a one-woman siege against Hell not once but TWICE over the previous few months, and brought their plans for Earth and the physical universe crashing down around them, not to mention also allegedly being the lone survivor of the catastrophes on the moon-bases on Phobos and Deimos in spite of not being even native to our own reality.
	- Extra Note 2: Any attempts to learn her true name, either by the UAC, others, or even Heiwa HERSELF have come up short, as she has forgotten a lot of her past, to the point of the appearance of what we can only all surmise is some kind of a cosmic conspiracy to keep her true name unknown to us and ESPECIALLY to Heiwa herself.
	- Extra Note 3: Heiwa has recently revealed a theory to her nickname being potentially one of the first threads of memory she kept from what she lost of them being transported from her reality to ours, and fears if she were to lose the memory of it on top of what she's already lost, that it could form the foundation of some kind of mental breakdown of a long term disorder. She's also theorized that whatever cosmic conspiracy is trying to prevent her and any others from recovering her true name might be doing so intentionally to attempt to drive her into said mental breakdown, though it too is currently unconfirmed, and even Heiwa cannot fathom of WHY this would be the case or what it would accomplish, seeing herself as a single girl in the whole of reality, and despite her being able to stop Hell twice now, doesn't see herself to be all too special in the grand scheme of reality.
	- Extra Note 4: She does NOT believe the Hellspawn and Hell itself are the causes of her memory loss though, to our surprise. She has long since come to her own conclusions that her encounters with the Hellspawn on Phobos, Deimos, Earth, and BOTH of her previous travels into and out of Hell imply the demons could merely be the PAWNS of a significantly more powerful force outside the bounds of the infernal realms. Only the word 'Origin' has come to her mind, remembering seeing the 'word inside my mind' after destroying the titanic demon known as Baphomet [i.e. the 'Icon of Sin'].
	- Extra Note 5: Not long after voicing her previous theory in note 4, she has suddenly started expressing the feeling she might have remembered the middle initial of her name: M. She does however admit this does little to bring back any other memories of her true name otherwise, and still prefers being called 'Heiwa' at the moment, seeing it as a sort of soldier's codename at this point, and having been used to it for several months by now.
* Nicknames: [Corrupted Information]Heiwa, [Corrupted Information]Heiwa, 'Heiwa', LadyHeiwa, [Corrupted Information], [Corrupted Information]
	- Extra Note: Heiwa and the UAC have both theorized the first and second nicknames are not fully known due to potentially being a memory of hers that could shed light on one part of her possible name. This is another reason we have reason to believe a cosmic conspiracy is active to prevent Heiwa or any potential allies or others in general of remembering her true name, though it is unconfirmed.
* Age: Between 15 and 16 Years of Age 
	- Extra Note 1: 'Heiwa' appears to possess the mental development of a 24 to 29 year old human woman however despite her teenage physical age, showing an incredible perception and maturity most teenagers of her age rarely show.
	- Extra Note 2: Birthday is estimated to be around April of 1984, based on limited attempts to remember her past.
	- Extra Note 3: She has fully rounded out her birthday to be that of April 8th, 1984, alongside remembering her home county of origin (Stark County of Northeast Ohio) and that of her true middle initial (M.).
* Species: Human, of Caucasian descent (at least from preliminary analysis)
* Sex/Gender: Female
* Hair: Light-Brown/Blonde Hybrid, usually waist length, tied in a long ponytail with a slim, simplished green ribbon at the top half of her scalp.
	- Extra Note: Heiwa herself prefers to use the term 'Chamois Cream' for the color of her hair.
* Eyes: Dark-Blue
* Height: 5'6" to 5'7" [estimated]
* Weight: 110 to 125 lbs [estimated]
* General Appearance/Clothing/Wardrobe: Her outfits vary, though there is almost always a purple or deluge color theme to her clothing when she has control of what she has to wear. She has also shown the ability to wear our various space-marines' armor such as Security, Combat and even Heavy Armors, though they are not without some level of physical encumbrance on her.
	- Extra Note 1: Further more, she often wears a pair of darker purple shorts, either of denim design, or a sports/gym variety alongside a lighter-purple colored sports bra, regardless of any other articles of clothing or armor she might choose to use, due to being a fairly athletic person from where she hailed from. She also tends to wear calf-high white or gray socks with purple colored running/athletic shoes.
	- Extra Note 2: Though her general figure is on the slender but toned side, she has constantly demonstrated physical capabilities well above that of a girl of her age not too long after she was forced to start fighting the forces of the Hellspawn during her fight and escape from the Phobos and Deimos Moon-bases and her first visit to Hell itself. 
	- Extra Note 3: She has shown the ability to carry and wield multiple weapons and firearms that even well trained space marines sometimes struggle to carry for long periods of time, such as the Black Hole Generator and the newly developed Calamity Blade [i.e. Heatwave Generator], among others.
	- Extra Note 4: She also has acquired three strange pieces of jewelry over her time in our timeline: a necklace or pendant with the shape of a winged, curled emblem, not too unlike the symbol of Caduceus of Greek history. A second item is a closed pocket-watch of which the top flip bears an IDENTICAL winged and curled emblem to that of her necklace. A third is a sort of slim wristband or bangle around her right wrist, also bearing a small symbol identical to that winged symbol. Also of note is that these three items have appeared in a multitude of different colors: silver-platinum, aqua-blue, lime-green, and a lighter-deluge purple.
* Homeworld: Earth (alternate reality and/or alternate timeline)
	- Extra Note: She is not however from OUR incarnation of Earth, believing she was flung into a different universe from that of her own, being she recalls living in the 1990s before she first found herself in the Hangar on Phobos here in our own universe in the year of 2145.
* Hometown: [unknown entirely, though she is familiar with being a resident of the United States of America in her home timeline and universe, possibly somewhere in the Great Lakes region]
	- Extra Note 1: UAC and Heiwa have recently been able to round down her home state to being somewhere in North-Northeast Ohio, though no more information has yet to be discovered.
	- Extra Note 2: Along with remembering that of her middle initial of her full name (M.), and the exact date of her birth (April 8th 1984), she also has reason to believe she is from the county of 'Stark' in Northeast Ohio, though she does not yet have a more exact area or city/town to her memories. We and her are hoping this could be the lead we need to crack this mystery...
* Psychological Profile/Notes:
	- Note 1: Though she is in fit mental health and shows no signs of insanity or other Hell-associated ailments of either mental or physical decree, 'Heiwa' is often in a state of depression and anger over her overall situation. She is not shy about cursing out beings like the Hellspawn in combat, or even some less agreeable UAC personnel at times, often with the fierceness of a seasoned sailor.
	- Note 2: Though she doesn't fully blame the UAC's scientists or the UAC's space-marine division for being overwhelmed by the initial invasion of Hellspawn on Phobos and Deimos, she has expressed a slightly negative disposition for the more conglomerate side of the corporation and some of their attempts to monetize on the discoveries of teleportation technology, feeling their greed could've had at least a minor and unintentional role leading up to the previous Hell invasions.
	- Note 3a: Dr. Raleigh recently unearthed some interesting things in a series of therapy sessions with Heiwa about her state of mind during various parts of Hell's initial invasions on Phobos, Deimos and then Earth: she had definitely been at her most scared and fearful during Phobos, and was definitely at the nadir of her abilities, admitting multiple times her unique ability to stop the flow of time for all but herself being key to her early survival. 
	- Note 3b: Her fear however became a grim determination to survive after almost dying from an alleged ambush of Hellspawn in the transition from the Phobos Anomaly to the Deimos Anomaly. It was during her travels through the corrupted Deimos moon-base she discovered her foes weren't merely alien creatures, but hell-born demons and zombies. She had grimly realized even before facing the 'Cyberdemon Lord' ruling a strange tower on Deimos that the moon was somehow already in Hell after it had disappeared from orbit around Mars. 
	- Note 3c: Her defeat of the Cyberdemon Lord and her subsequent descent into Hell for the first time then was the on-set of her initial fury at them, having promised to tear as many of them apart that obstructed her way as possible before her potential demise, to the point she even ultimately overwhelmed and annihilated the first of the Spider Masterminds and escaped to Earth, making her possibly the first person that ever entered Hell to have also been able to escape it.
	- Note 3d: However upon arriving at Earth, she had come out near a Hellspawn-ravaged ruin of a city in middle Indiana, and her fury became interwoven with a sort of mourning rage, not yet knowing specifically that she was not actually back on HER version of Earth, or in her own time, and believing the invasion was likely the death of any potential family and friends she could've found to help her recover her memories. It was only sometime after the defeat of the SECOND Spider Mastermind, then that of a third, and that of a FOURTH Cyberdemon, and by the time she had disengaged Hell's fiery-forcefield around our central Starport to help our escape into space, that she realized somewhere along the way of it being over 150 years past her own time.
	- Note 3e: Her subsequent travels to Mesquite, Texas, the core location of the central invasion gateway from Hell on Earth, had brought her mourning fury into a tranquil and focused affair at last, though she also mentioned during her time in the city of the feeling of being put into some kind of cosmic 'trial' where to pass, she might have to save OUR Earth from the demons, though she also came to theorize that if some cosmic force HAD been responsible for this, it might not have been one with any good intentions for either us OR her. When she got to the mouth of the gate to Hell in the heart of Mesquite, she jumped back in immediately. She told us she had learned how to sense the background energy of Hell and other things of spiritual nature during her travels, and believed the source of the invasion was back inside.
	- Note 3f: Heiwa continued explaining that as she had returned to Hell, she had then sensed the essence of a 'titanic demon of eldritch like origins', and that she had grimly even began to feel excited at the prospect of meeting and then "tearing and ripping it apart". She also mentioned that the further in she made her way, the more she came to a sort of conclusion that Hell and the demonic entities within, for how much destruction and chaos they had wreathed upon Earth, as well as Phobos and Deimos, might have only been "mere pawns of a more powerful force", even stating the eldritch energy source she felt was likely naught but a pawn itself, though she also surmised the Hellspawn were unwitting pawns in this cosmic being's game, believing if they were aware of such, they might choose to act differently in how they had planned out their invasion of Earth.
	- Note 3g: She then finally accounts of her brief battle with the creature we would later codename as "Baphomet" or "The Icon of Sin". She had learned quickly that the creature's brain, exposed to her various explosive weapons, served as an easy weakpoint to obliterate it. But even as it had exploded into pieces and as its destruction annihilated a huge physical segment of Hell itself, Heiwa had suddenly received a word into her mind: 'Origin'. She's not sure even now if it was a word spoken to her by the dying Icon, or if it was a hint given to her as some kind of reward for 'passing her trial'. What she does believe is that being she did NOT return to her original time and universe after the Icon's defeat, that she is not done with her alleged trial yet. It wasn't long after that when she had returned to our Earth through the gate that was still lingering in Mesquite, deciding she would try to help us in the rebuilding process, and/or offer to fend off any future threats from Hell that might try to capitalize on the planet's weakened defenses, at least until more information related to her situation could be learned.
* Unique Traits/Abilities:
	- Note 1: Heiwa possesses one extremely incredible ability that she had even had from her initial arrival into our reality in the Hangar outpost on the Phobos Moon-base: an ability that allows her to halt the flow of time-space for at least 10 seconds or longer at a time. This ability, from Heiwa's own claim, extends in duration by roughly a full second at a time for every 20 or so times she uses it. It also however has a cooldown of as long as 45 seconds between uses. She mentioned however that this cooldown has decreased considerably as she's practiced it. There is no doubt in our minds that a lot of Heiwa's earliest ability to survive Phobos, Deimos and her first visit to Hell were connected to usage of her power in surgically precise situations in combat with the zombies and forces of the Hellspawn.
	- Note 2: Though not so much an ability, Heiwa also appeared on Phobos with possession of a large and powerful combat knife that she has been forced to use thousands of times since to carve away zombies and various Hellspawn. Though she doesn't have the clearest of memories as to WHY she had this knife, she has reason to believe it is a family heirloom, maybe given to her as a gift from an older relative. The knife is definitely combat-ready though, and Heiwa has often shown the ability to block and/or parry enemy projectiles, sometimes even bullets, with well swung attacks of the knife.
		- Sidenote 2: She also has recently gained a sort of actual ability concerning the knife. She claims the ability to tap into arcane or magical forces that allow her to create "copies" of her combat knife that she flings at enemies from a distance, though she cannot do this for too long in prolonged combat situations, needing to mentally rest to rejuvenate her magic energy to do so.
	- Note 3: Heiwa also possesses the ability to perform short bursts of immense speed similar to that of a dashing motion. She briefly appears to become non-corporeal to both solid objects, living creatures and even projectiles and other enemy attacks for a brief moment while doing this, allowing her to dash out of being cornered or through a powerful projectile like a rocket provided she times it right. She can also combine her dash with various weapons such as the "Hell Warrior's Shield", or if she's defending herself in hand-to-hand with a cross-armed guard, she can shoulder-tackle foes in front of her, also stunning them for long durations.
* Known Arsenal:
	- Hand to Hand: Despite her slender and petite-ish frame, Heiwa is proficient enough in unarmed combat, able to both throw hands with her foes, as well as focus uppercuts and throw powerful mule-strength kicks, often able to stun her foes for extended periods of time. She also has the ability to put herself into a supremely defensive position by crossing her arms into an X-formation in front of her. For some reason, she's been confirmed to take significantly less damage in this state, and even less so against the melee attacks of her foes, though this will slow her down immensely in movement, due to the amount of focus she puts into the defensive guard in this state.
	- Combat Knife: As mentioned above, her Combat Knife is an essential tool for her in melee combat. It is also believed to be custom-sized, being well bigger than what girls of her age and size would be expected to be able to proficiently wield. Yet she is still able to do so with such accuracy that she can even bat and parry projectiles out of the air with close-to-perfect accuracy. She can sometimes even block ballistic, sound-speed attacks like bullets with well-time swings. She also had eventually learned a magic-based ability to toss "copies" of her knife via weird space-time portals. These thrown knives can also pierce and rip through multiple targets in a line-formation. They also occasionally tear down in-flight projectiles as well.
	- Glock 21: Her most basic sidearm, Heiwa has use of a Glock 21 with two customized ammo varieties: one that can deal decent damage to single targets, and then a variant, which while not as damaging, can penetrate multiple targets in a row, and might also have the occasional potential to pierce solid surfaces.
	- Blaster Pistol: An energy-cell alternative to her Glock 21, Heiwa has been seen wielding not just one, but occasionally TWO specialized energy blasters. These pistols usually consume energy cells for standard blasts, but can be set to draw upon a weaker, though persistent sort of on-board rechargeable energy battery to shoot very low power shots, or if its battery is fully charged, allow a single full-powered shot free of any cell charge.
	- Riot Gun: Heiwa's only known weapon that directly utilizes shotgun shells. A four-barreled shotgun cannon that cycles through the four barrels akin to a chaingun. Can be shot one barrel at a time, or put into an alternate mode that can rapid-fire up to four barrels in a cycle before needing reloaded. Has a moderate level of accuracy that is less accurate than a standard Combat Shotgun, but more so than the Super Shotgun.
	- Thompson Machine Gun: For some strange reason, Heiwa has become attached to not just one, but often a PAIR of these old-fashion early 1900s Machine Guns. They fire fast, but lack a bit of overall accuracy. Despite this, Heiwa seems to almost have an uncharacteristically child-like glee and attachment to using these against the Hellspawn and our other enemies, and it helps the drum cartridges of this weapon have 50 bullets per drum.
	- EF-11 Blaster Rifle: An alternate option Heiwa possesses to the Blaster Pistol. Like the Pistol, it too can utilize Energy Cells or alternatively use an on-board rechargeable energy battery to fire weaker shots at a slower rate, or if the battery is at full charge, a full-powered shot for no cost of any external energy cells. Holding down the fire mode of this weapon will slowly speed up its fire rate for a while.
	- Devastator Weapon: A powerful dual-missile barrel launcher created in the 1990s by various weapon-smiths at the Pentagon, later adapted to have a use in single barrel modes, and given an alternative sort of "shotgun burst" firing mode, Heiwa tends to enjoy using this weapon against more durable and tankier demons, though the missiles used by this weapon are a very different and smaller breed than that of general UAC-issue rockets.
	- Deviation Dumb-Missile Launcher: This weapon is one of Heiwa's most dangerous, being a type of rocket launcher that launches rockets well more powerful than that of UAC-grade rockets, and that of the Cyberdemon's similar rockets. The missiles have a much wider blast radius, and hit roughly twice as hard, with the power to demolish large clusters of standard-level humanoid targets. One other note is of its faster-firing sort of "drunk seeker" mode, allowing Heiwa to launch rockets quickly, but with very erratic patterns of movement that attempt to heat-seek nearby foes.
	- Tesla Cannon: An older [seemingly] model of electrical generator weapon for dispersal of electric spheres at foes. Good at dealing with the likes of mechanical demons, having the ability to stun them for longer by briefly stalling up their systems. Heiwa also has the capacity to dual wield these or wield them solo. The cannons also have a charge-fire mode that consumes the equivalent of 35 energy units per shot, but also has a large amount of backfire against the user in close range. These also use an unique form of Tesla batteries for its ammunition, making finding ammo somewhat of a challenge.
	- Incinerator: A brand new, energy-cell powered, off-the-presses temperature control weapon, generally allowing the use of incinerating flames, but also possesses an alternate mode that flash-freezes the temperatures of the flames, creating a frost-fire burst of flames that can chill creatures to the bone. Most demons tend to be susceptible to the frost-fire flames and resistant to standard fire, though zombies are generally also greatly affected by standard fire. This weapon has some safety issues due to the intensity of the flames emitted from it, whether hot or cold, making it likely to harm oneself if fired at very close range to its target. Heiwa's apparently sometimes in possession of an unique "armor" that allows her to shrug off fire and ice though, giving her some unique uses of the weapons many other UAC marines and operatives cannot use it for. 
	- Black Hole Generator: A prototype singularity generator device created on Deimos, which was partially finished when the Hellspawn had ripped Deimos from our dimension into Hell. This device will create black holes of three different sizes at different costs to energy cells. The black holes only last a set duration based on the size and cell-cost, though they are just as potentially dangerous to a user as they are to any other creatures that are a set distance around the black holes.
		- CRITICAL NOTE: However an extremely important exception to this is that of HEIWA HERSELF. Somehow, through some unknown means, HEIWA ALONE is immune to this effect from the black holes of the generator, whether they are launched from her generator, or that of an enemy. She has no clue as to why she seems to uniquely possess this immunity to the effects and the pull and gravity of black holes like this though.
	- Calamity Blade: A powerful energy-cell powered arbalest-like super weapon recently created as an alternative weapon to the BFG9000. This weapon has the capacity to charge two different forms of attack waves: a large and massive wave that can consume between 10 to 100 cells in levels of 1 to 10 per charge for a wave of nearly 140 degrees in spread. The smaller attack charges faster, costing from 3 to 15 cells, at 3 cells per charge, up to 5 charges, that launches a much smaller wave that only covers around 70 degrees. Both types of waves rip and tear through multiple foes, giving it an incredible crowd-clearing ability, with no backfire or side-effects that can threaten the user's safety.
	- Impaler Crossbow: A small sized crossbow which has a zooming lens to allow very well precise shots. Heiwa often uses this as a substitution for a shotgun and super shotgun when lacking the Riot Gun. It also possesses the ability to deal significantly extra damage against unaware and/or distracted foes.
	- Ripsaw Launcher: A strange and crude kind of alternative to the standard issue "Eager Beaver" chainsaws under the UAC's use, this device has an exposed form of saw blade for its cutting power, which can often be launched as an individual projectile that can "rip" through multiple enemies in a line formation. The weapon can also be souped up by revving the melee cutting mode and then forcibly launching a saw to boost its speed and damage. It also seems to be a weapon Heiwa often relies on in spaces of frozen time of her own creation, stating most forms of direct damage in frozen time are greatly shrugged off by her foes, and the speed of the Ripsaws' cutting force is often enough to offset this usual downside of her time-stop power.
	- Hell Warrior's Shield: A weapon belonging to a species of satyr-like Hellspawn known as the "Hell Warrior", this shield possesses both protective ability from frontal attacks, as well as the ability to fire magical ripping green blasts towards its foes. It is believed that multiple shields can be collected to upgrade the user's original shield and make it more powerful and defensive, but also boosting its encumbrance on the user. Heiwa can also use the shield in defensive mode with her ability to 'shadow dash' to shield bash through her foes.
	- Phobos Dust Blower: A prototype sort of reverse vacuum-pack launcher that UAC scientists on Phobos had been developing at the time of the initial Hellspawn invasions: the Dust Blower was intended for both vacuuming and blowing capabilities, but it was not finished in time for the vacuuming aspect to work. However thankfully the blowers' power is souped up to the point it blows away not only most forms of dust, but also other living personnel, Hellspawn, zombies, and even a majority of the projectile blasts of various weapons and/or Hellspawn, even including the Rockets of Cyberdemons. This does have some push-back on lighter users, such as Heiwa herself, though this push-back could in theory also work as a bit of a thruster for boosting her jumps if she shoots straight down as she jumps.
	- Teleporter Beacon: A unknown device moreso than a proper weapon. Despite the name, it is NOT of UAC origin, and even Heiwa, the only one known to show possession of the device, doesn't seem to know of its exact origins. However in spite of this, the device can be used to launch single green beacons that bounce off solid surfaces and then land somewhere. The device allows the user to then perform a one-time teleport to the spot of the landed beacon, though this removes the beacon in question, returning it to the launching apparatus of the device. It has been noted that this CAN be weaponized to perform a micro-"telefrag" on foes who are in very close to a beacon when Heiwa teleports herself, though it is not always an instant kill against said foes unlike most instances of teleportation we're used to. She also seems to gain a boost of evasive power and defensive power briefly post-teleport, though this last for but a couple of moments.
