(Misfit's Word of God Note: The following file is written from the perspective of various UAC officials as a combined group about Heiwa, and it is assumed it is written at some point AFTER the events of her version of Doom 2: Hell of Earth, post Icon of Sin battle at the earliest :V)

* Full Name: [First Name Corrupted] M. [Surname Corrupted] 
	- Extra Note 1: Currently only known as 'Heiwa', a codename she has said herself seems to be an old memory of a nickname of hers. Heiwa is actually a name of Japanese origin [i.e 平和], being the word for 'peace', which is extreme ironic considering it was Heiwa who ultimately led a one-woman siege against Hell not once but TWICE over the previous year, and brought their plans for Earth and the physical universe crashing down around them, not to mention also allegedly being the lone survivor of the catastrophes on the moonbases on Phobos and Deimos in spite of not being even native to our own reality.
	- Extra Note 2: Any attempts to learn her true name, either by the UAC, others, or even Heiwa HERSELF have come up short, as she has forgotten a lot of her past, to the point of the appearance of what we can only all surmise is some kind of a cosmic conspiracy to keep her true name unknown to us and ESPECIALLY to Heiwa herself.
	- Extra Note 3: Heiwa has recently revealed a theory to her nickname being potentially one of the first threads of memory she kept from what she lost of them being transported from her reality to ours, and fears if she were to lose the memory of it on top of what she's already lost, that it could form the foundation of some kind of mental breakdown of a long term disorder. She's also theorized that whatever cosmic conspiracy is trying to prevent her and any others from recovering her true name might be doing so intentionally to attempt to drive her into said mental breakdown, though it too is currently unconfirmed, and even Heiwa cannot fathom of WHY this would be the case or what it would accomplish, seeing herself as a single girl in the whole of reality, and despite her being able to stop Hell twice now, doesn't see herself to be all too special in the grand scheme of reality.
	- Extra Note 4: She does NOT believe the Hellspawn and Hell itself are the causes of her memory loss though, to our surprise. She has long since come to her own conclusions that her encounters with the Hellspawn on Phobos, Deimos, Earth, and BOTH of her previous travels into and out of Hell imply the demons could merely be the PAWNS of a significantly more powerful force outside the bounds of the infernal realms. Only the world 'Origin' has come to her mind, remembering seeing the 'word inside my mind' after destroying the titanic demon known as Baphomet [i.e. the 'Icon of Sin'].
	- Extra Note 5: Not long after voicing her previous theory in note 4, she has suddenly started expressing the feeling she might have remembered the middle initial of her name: M. She does however admit this does little to bring back any other memories of her true name otherwise, and still prefers being called 'Heiwa' at the moment, seeing it as a sort of soldier's codename at this point, and having been used to it for several months by now.
* Nicknames: [Corrupted Information]Heiwa, [Corrupted Information]Heiwa, 'Heiwa', LadyHeiwa, [Corrupted Information], [Corrupted Information]
	- Extra Note: Heiwa and the UAC have both theorized the first and second nicknames are not fully known due to potentially being a memory of hers that could shed light on one part of her possible name. This is another reason we have reason to believe a cosmic conspiracy is active to prevent Heiwa or any potential allies or others in general of remembering her true name, though it is unconfirmed.
* Age: Between 15 and 16 Years of Age 
	- Extra Note 1: 'Heiwa' appears to possess the mental development of a 24 to 29 year old human woman however despite her teenage physical age, showing an incredible perception and maturity most teenagers of her age rarely show.
	- Extra Note 2: Birthday is estimated to be around April of 1999, based on limited attempts to remember her past.
	- Extra Note 3: She has fully rounded out her birthday to be that of April 8th, 1999, alongside remembering her home county of origin (Stark County of Northeast Ohio) and that of her true middle initial (M.).
* Species: Human, of Caucasian descent (at least from preliminary analysis)
* Sex/Gender: Female
* Hair: Light-Brown/Blonde Hybrid, usually waist length, tied in a long ponytail with a slim, simplished green ribbon at the top half of her scalp.
	- Extra Note: Heiwa herself prefers to use the term 'Chamois Cream' for the color of her hair.
* Eyes: Dark-Blue
* Height: 5'6" to 5'7" [estimated]
* Weight: 110 to 125 lbs [estimated]
* General Appearance/Clothing/Wardrobe: Her outfits vary, though there is almost always a purple or deluge color theme to her clothing when she has control of what she has to wear. She has also shown the ability to wear our various space-marines' armor such as Security, Combat and even Heavy Armors, though they are not without some level of physical encumbrance on her.
	- Extra Note 1: Further more, she often wears a pair of darker purple shorts, either of denim design, or a sports/gym variety alongside a lighter-purple colored sports bra, regardless of any other articles of clothing or armor she might choose to use, due to being a fairly athletic person from where she hailed from. She also tends to wear calf-high white or gray socks with purple colored running/athletic shoes.
	- Extra Note 2: Though her general figure is on the slender but toned side, she has constantly demonstrated physical capabilities well above that of a girl of her age not too long after she was forced to start fighting the forces of the Hellspawn during her fight and escape from the Phobos and Deimos Moonbases and her first visit to Hell itself. 
	- Extra Note 3: She has shown the ability to carry and wield multiple weapons and firearms that even well trained space marines sometimes struggle to carry for long periods of time, such as the Black Hole Generator and the newly developed Calamity Blade [i.e. Heatwave Generator], among others.
	- Extra Note 4: She also has acquired three strange pieces of jewelry over her time in our timeline: a necklace or pendant with the shape of a winged, curled emblem, not too unlike the symbol of Caduceus of Greek history. A second item is a closed pocket-watch of which the top flip bears an IDENTICAL winged and curled emblem to that of her necklace. A third is a sort of slim wristband or bangle around her right wrist, also bearing a small symbol identical to that winged symbol. Also of note is that these three items have appeared in a multitude of different colors: silver-platinum, aqua-blue, lime-green, and a lighter-deluge purple.
* Homeworld: Earth (alternate reality and/or alternate timeline)
	- Extra Note: She is not however from OUR incarnation of Earth, believing she was flung into a different universe from that of her own, being she recalls living in the 1990s before she first found herself in the Hangar on Phobos here in our own universe in the year of 2145.
* Hometown: [unknown entirely, though she is familiar with being a resident of the United States of America in her home timeline and universe, possibly somewhere in the Great Lakes region]
	- Extra Note 1: UAC and Heiwa have recently been able to round down her home state to being somewhere in North-Northeast Ohio, though no more information has yet to be discovered.
	- Extra Note 2: Along with remembering that of her middle initial of her full name (M.), and the exact date of her birth (April 8th, 1999), she also has reason to believe she is from the county of 'Stark' in Northeast Ohio, though she does not yet have a more exact area or city/town to her memories. We and her are hoping this could be the lead we need to crack this mystery...
* Psychological Profile/Notes:
	- Note 1: Though she is in fit mental health and shows no signs of insanity or other Hell-associated ailments of either mental or physical decree, 'Heiwa' is often in a state of depression and anger over her overall situation. She is not shy about cursing out beings like the Hellspawn in combat, or even some less agreeable UAC personnel at times, often with the fierceness of a seasoned sailor. 
	- Note 2: Though she doesn't fully blame the UAC's scientists or the UAC's space-marine devision for being overwhelmed by the initial invasion of Hellspawn on Phobos and Deimos, she has expressed a slightly negative disposition for the more conglomerate side of the corporation and some of their attempts to monetize on the discoveries of teleportation technology, feeling their greed could've had at least a minor and unintentional role leading up to the previous Hell invasions.
	- Note 3a: Dr. Raleigh recently unearthed some interesting things in a therapy session with Heiwa about her state of mind during various parts of Hell's initial invasions on Phobos, Deimos and then Earth: she had definitely been at her most scared and fearful during Phobos, and was definitely at the nadir of her abilities, admitting multiple times her unique ability to stop the flow of time for all but herself being key to her early survival. 
	- Note 3b: Her fear however became a grim determination to survive after almost dying from an alleged ambush of hellspawn in the transition from the Phobos Anomaly to the Deimos Anomaly. It was during her travels through the corrupted Deimos moonbase she discovered her foes weren't merely alien creatures, but hell-born demons and zombies. She had even grimly realized even before facing the 'Cyberdemon Lord' ruling a strange tower on Deimos that the moon was somehow already in Hell after it had disappeared from orbit around Mars. 
	- Note 3c: Her defeat of the Cyberdemon Lord and her subsequent descent into Hell for the first them then was the on-set of her initial fury at them, having promised to tear as many of them apart that obstructed her way as possible before her potential demise, to the point she even ultimately overwhelmed and annihilated the first of the Spider Masterminds and escaped to Earth, making her possibly the first person that ever entered Hell to have also been able to escape it.
	- Note 3d: However upon arriving at Earth, she had come out near a hellspawn-ravaged ruin of a city in middle Indiana, and her fury became interwoven with a sort of mourning rage, not yet knowing specifically that she was not actually back on HER version of Earth, or in her own time, and believing the invasion was likely the death of any potential family and friends she could've found to help her recover her memories. It was only sometime after the defeat of the SECOND Spider Mastermind, then that of a third, and that of a FOURTH Cyberdemon, and by the time she had disengaged Hell's firey-forcefield around our central Starport to help our escape into space, that she realized somewhere along the way of it being over 150 years past her own time.
	- Note 3e: Her subsequent travels to Mesquite, Texas, the core location of the central invasion gateway from Hell on Earth, had brought her mourning fury into a tranquil and focused affair at last, though she also mentioned during her time in the city of the feeling of being put into some kind of cosmic 'trial' where to pass, she might have to save OUR Earth from the demons, though she also came to theorize that if some cosmic force HAD been responsible for this, it might not have been one with any good intentions for either us OR her. When she got to the mouth of the gate to Hell in the heart of Mesquite, she jumped back in immediately. She told us she had learned how to sense the background energy of Hell and other things of spiritual nature during her travels, and believed the source of the invasion was back inside.
	- Note 3f: Heiwa continued explaining that as she had returned to Hell, she had then sensed the essence of a 'titanic demon of eldritch like origins', and that she had grimly even began to feel excited at the prospect of meeting and then "tearing and ripping it apart". She also mentioned that the further in she made her way, the more she came to a sort of conclusion that Hell and the demonic entities within, for how much destruction and chaos they had wreathed upon Earth, as well as Phobos and Deimos, might have only been "mere pawns of a more powerful force", even stating the eldritch energy source she felt was likely naught but a pawn itself, though she also surmised the Hellspawn were unwitting pawns in this cosmic being's game, believing if they were aware of such, they might choose to act differently in how they had planned out their invasion of Earth.
	- Note 3g: She then finally accounts of her brief battle with the creature we would later codename as "Baphomet" or "The Icon of Sin". She had learned quickly that the creatures brain, exposed to her various explosive weapons, served as an easy weakpoint to obliterate it. But even as it had exploded into pieces and as its destruction annihilated a huge physical segment of Hell itself, Heiwa had suddenly received a word into her mind: 'Origin'. She's not sure even now if it was a word spoken to her by the dying Icon, or if it was a hint given to her as some kind of reward for 'passing her trial'. What she does believe is that being she did NOT return to her original time and universe after the Icon's defeat, that she is not done with her alleged trial yet. It wasn't long after that when she had returned to our Earth through the gate that was still lingering in Mesquite, deciding she would try to help us in the rebuilding process, and/or offer to fend off any future threats from Hell that might try to capitalize on the planet's weakened defenses, at least until more information related to her situation could be learned.
* Unique Traits/Abilities:
	- Note 1: Heiwa possesses one incredible ability that she had even had from her initial arrival into our reality in the Hangar outpost on the Phobos Moonbase: an ability that allows her to halt the flow of time-space for at least 10 seconds or longer at a time. This ability, from Heiwa's own claim, extends in duration by roughly a full second at a time for every 20 or so times she uses it. It also however has a cooldown of as long as 45 seconds between uses. She mentioned however that this cooldown has decreased considerably as she's practiced it. There is no doubt in our minds that a lot of Heiwa's earliest ability to survive Phobos, Deimos and her first visit to Hell were connected to usage of her power in surgically precise situations in combat with the zombies and forces of the hellspawn.
	- Note 2: Though not so much an ability, Heiwa also appeared on Phobos with possession of a large and powerful combat knife that she has been forced to use 1000s of times since to carve away zombies and various hellspawn. Though she doesn't have the clearest of memories as to WHY she had this knife, she has reason to believe it is a family heirloom, maybe given to her as a gift from an older relative. The knife is definitely combat-ready though.
		- Sidenote 2: She also has recently gained a sort of actual ability concerning the knife. She claims the ability to tap into arcane or magical forces that allow her to create "copies" of her combat knife that she flings at enemies from a distance, though she cannot do this for too long in prolonged combat situations, needing to mentally rest to rejuvenate her magic energy to do so.
